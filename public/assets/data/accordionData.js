    "HiFi" and application architecture. How it will look and work
    on completion. Conducting user testing to verify a friendly and
    welcoming UI/UX.
    The "HiFi's" will be shared via a link which
    gives the possibility to navigate the application and create
    comments and notes. A final meeting is arranged to review
    aforementioned "HiFi's".
    Hopefully everything is in order and

    agreed upon "Hifi's", on completion the application should be
    almost identical to these. During this phase we deploy a
    development site, you will receive a link, so you can monitor the
    progress made. As Heraclitus said "change is the only constant in
    life". Which is why we'll have small check-in's to make sure
    you're happy and discuss any changes and how to approach them. We
    use automated testing, which reduces bugs, improves
    maintainability and a higher standard of code. Less problems for
    you and less head scratching for us. Thatâ€™s it, time to move
    forward.`,
